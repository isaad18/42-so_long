## Description
``
Created a 2D game that takes a map file as an arguement that can contain '1' as a wall, '0' as an empty space, 'P' as the player's starting position, 'E' as the exit from the map, 'C' as the collectable. This game only ends when the player collects all the collectables and then exits using the keys from the keyboard "WASD". Moreover, this game has few rules to make it challenging for the parsing which has to be surrounded by walls, and there has to be at least one collectable, only one player starting position and only one exit.
``

##QuickStart

#### Makefile is provided with the MLX (LINUX version), all you have to do is to enter the directory then
```
make all
```

#### now all the files are executed and we got the executable file named "so_long" execute it using the sample map
```
./so_long/maps/hello.ber
```
